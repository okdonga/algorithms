# Algorithm exercises
This repo contains various algorithm problems that I have solved. Feel free to add suggestions on the code or anything!

1. Heap Sort in Ruby and Python
⋅⋅* Heap sort took me a while to understand its logic and eventually to code it out. After studying various resources online, I have finally come up with a working solution. I first coded this in Ruby, and carried the same logic to Python, which is a new language that I have been picking up lately.
